COPY OF AN OLD README AS A TEMPLATE

##  Introduction

This project produces an article on FracFocus (Up to November 2023) in pdf, with plots following the style guidelines(v1.2, May 2017) of The Economist. 

## Requirements

Analysis and plots were generated by Python 3.12.1 (https://www.python.org/downloads/). A full list of python packages used is in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) and can be installed in your environment via `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project folder directory. 

The [Jupyter notebook](./explore.ipynb) is for more convenient visualisation and installing jupyter notebook is not strictly required (although it is listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)). All production code in the jupyter notebook have also been duplicated as py files in [src](./src) and [analyses](./analyses/) for a more convenient workflow.

Pdf was generated via LaTeX and you will need a LaTeX engine. We used MiKTeX (https://miktex.org/) and TeXworks (https://www.tug.org/texworks/) but you are welcome to use other equivalents.

## data

This directory contains all raw and derived datasets of FracFocus. We recommend installing (https://fracfocus.org/data-download) the csv into the [./data/raw](./data/raw) such that `./data/raw/FracFocusCSV/FracFocusRegistry_1.csv` is the the relative path.

## src

Includes source code to helpful functions: e.g. replace NA (in data-cleaning) or rolling mean (in helper-functions)

## resources

Includes Econ Sans fonts files, shapefiles for states in USA and the research paper we referenced for regulatory disclosure. See the [specific readme](./resources/README.md) for more details.

## output

Contains raw plots and figures generated by analyses.

## makefile

Requires `make`(https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to use. Provides an automated way to build the final product if any changes are made to scripts or data. [article.pdf](./article.pdf) is the main output with the dependencies being the plots, which itself is dependent on the [compiled data](./data/derived/FracFocusRegistry_full.csv).
