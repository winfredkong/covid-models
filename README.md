## Introduction

This project produces a paper that aims to model the number of deaths, hospitalizations and ICU admissions as a function of other predictors. The dataset was taken from [OWID Covid 19 Dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master).

## Requirements

Analysis and plots were generated by Python 3.12.1 (https://www.python.org/downloads/). A full list of python packages used is in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) and can be installed in your environment via `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project folder directory. 

The [Jupyter notebook](./explore.ipynb) is for more convenient visualisation and installing jupyter notebook is not strictly required (although it is listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)). All production code in the jupyter notebook have also been duplicated as py files in [src](./src) for a more convenient workflow.

Pdf was generated via LaTeX and you will need a LaTeX engine. We used MiKTeX (https://miktex.org/) and TeXworks (https://www.tug.org/texworks/) but you are welcome to use other equivalents.

## data

This directory contains all raw and derived datasets of the OWID COVID-19 Dataset. We recommend downloading the [full dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv) into the [./data/raw](./data/raw) such that `./data/raw/owid-covid-data.csv` is the the relative path.

## src

Includes all source code for producing plots and training the model.

[Helper functions](./src/helper_functions/): contains helpful functions e.g. prepping ddata or training functions

[latex](./src/latex/): contains plots, tables and tex file for producing pdf

[Plotting scripts](./src/plots/): contain scripts for generating plots

[main](./src/main/): contains the main scripts that compute tables and trains the models

## output

Contains raw plots and tables generated by analyses. Also contains checkpoints for neural network training.

## makefile

Requires `make`(https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to use. Provides an automated way to build the final product if any changes are made to scripts or data. [document.pdf](./document.pdf) is the main output with the dependencies being the plots, which itself has many dependencies like plots and tables.
